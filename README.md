# 🛡️ Intrusion Detection System using Snort (Mini Project)

This project demonstrates the configuration and use of **Snort**, an open-source Intrusion Detection System (IDS), in a virtual lab environment. The setup includes writing and deploying custom Snort rules to detect common network threats such as **brute-force** and **port scan attacks**. The project also involves capturing and analyzing network traffic using tools like **Wireshark** and **tcpdump**.

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Configure Snort IDS in a local/virtual lab environment.
- Create custom Snort rules to detect:
  - Brute-force login attempts
  - Port scanning activity
- Capture and analyze alerts using:
  - `snort.alert.fast` logs
  - PCAP files from tcpdump/Wireshark

- 🐷 **Snort** (IDS engine)
- 🧪 **Custom Rules** (.rules file)
- 🖥️ **VirtualBox/VMware** (for virtual environment)
- 🐙 **Ubuntu/Linux** (preferred environment)
- 📊 **Wireshark** (for traffic analysis)
- 📦 **tcpdump** (for packet capture)
